# Search Engine with Next.js 13, SWR, Axios, and Tailwind CSS

This is a simple search engine built using Next.js 13, SWR, Axios, and Tailwind CSS. The search engine retrieves search results from an external API and displays them in a user-friendly interface.

## Features

- Search functionality: Enter a search query and get relevant search results.
- Real-time results: Results are displayed instantly as you type, thanks to SWR (stale-while-revalidate) data fetching.
- Responsive design: The interface is designed to adapt to different screen sizes, providing a seamless experience on desktop and mobile devices.
